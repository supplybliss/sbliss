This is truly how Supply Bliss has come to fruition. Our store is based in a small town of Southern Kentucky. One of the founders has been watching small business come back to downtown Corbin, and helping the city grow. Dana the original owner used to run a small business where she did custom shirts and sold to a local market. The problem with that was I could never find the supplies I needed and then when I did I would have to go to three or four stores to find what I needed. So when Dana met the other half of the team Keith who had 20+ years of business, design, &amp; technical experience Dana's dream of having her own business in Corbin began to take place. It has been in the works with lots of planning and research to get to where we are today. We have grown to where we have been able to fill a niche here where people are able to get supplies they need, right here in this small town. Bringing business and future jobs to a struggling community. So when we decided to expand our local store to a larger scale we hope to continue to grow and help support our small town by providing more jobs and helping the economy grow more by helping our customers fill their demands easier and with less prices.

We have high aspirations &amp; goals at Supply Bliss and first and foremost is being a one stop shop for customer's needs. Currently we are only have part of our business up and running, being the apparel side that meets customers needs. In the future we will be expanding to offer items such as heat transfer vinyl of various varieties, blanks of all sorts as the trends grow and change with time, as well as supplies many of our customers will need to complete their tasks. Our idea when starting Supply Bliss is what inspired our name, we want to be that one stop shop where you can go to order all your supplies in one order at one time. Receive all your items that you need to complete a customer's order or just fill your stock up without having to wait for the other pieces of the puzzle to come together. When we were in the other side of the business it was so annoying to get our vinyl in one day, then the next day we had to wait for our shirts. That is what inspired us to start Supply Bliss and we hope you continue to grow with us as we expand to meet you the customer's needs.

You may say Corbin, Kentucky where in the world is that. This would not be an uncommon question. We are a small town located on the very edge of Southern Ky &amp; the Tennessee border. But to be such a small town we are known globally actually for one reason. If you have ever ate from any of the famous Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants across the globe. Colonel Sanders dream began here in this small town. We are home to the very first KFC that was known as Colonels Cafe &amp; Motel. Which people come from all over the US to see and take their picture in front of the infamous building. In addition to being known for excellent fried chicken. We are also home to one of natures most beautiful creations. Cumberland Falls is known as the Niagara of the south being the largest natural formed waterfall south of the Niagara. What makes Cumberland Falls even more rare is the fact that various times during the year you can experience a moonbow. A rainbow created by the moon that is known to cross over the falls several times a year. We are very proud of our little small town and the roots we have here. In the past year as stated we have seen small business make a rise and stand up in this town and we are so excited to be a part of it. Below are a couple links in case you want to visit our beautiful town and visit some of the historic places and check out all our small business owners down main street where you will find excellent food offerings, antiques, wine tastings, and art studios.
